About this report
Report description

Reproducible web application vulnerability assessment using OWASP ZAP 2.16.1 against OWASP Juice Shop (Docker) on Kali Linux.

Scope: http://localhost:3000 (local Juice Shop instance).

Methodology: define context -> spider (crawl) -> passive scan -> active scan (Low strength, Medium threshold) -> manual verification.

Tools: OWASP ZAP (GUI), Docker (juice-shop).

Date: 9/28/2025.

Notes: This report includes request/response evidence collected during testing. Session files and raw requests may contain sensitive tokens, sanitize before public sharing.
Report parameters

    http://localhost:3000

(If no sites were selected, all sites were included by default.)

An included site must also be within one of the included contexts for its data to be included in the report.
Risk levels

Included: High, Medium, Low, Informational

Excluded: None
Confidence levels

Included: User Confirmed, High, Medium, Low

Excluded: User Confirmed, High, Medium, Low, False Positive

Alert counts by site and risk

This table shows, for each site for which one or more alerts were raised, the number of alerts raised at each risk level.

Alerts with a confidence level of "False Positive" have been excluded from these counts.

(The numbers in brackets are the number of alerts raised for the site at or above that risk level.)
