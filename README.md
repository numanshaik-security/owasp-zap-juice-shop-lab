# OWASP ZAP ‚Äì Juice Shop Lab

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates a hands-on web application vulnerability assessment using **OWASP ZAP** against the **OWASP Juice Shop** application running in Docker.  
The goal was to simulate a structured security assessment aligned with the **OWASP Top 10**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment
- Kali Linux (VirtualBox VM)
- Docker: OWASP Juice Shop container
- OWASP ZAP 2.16.1 (GUI mode)

## üîç Methodology
1. Define scope (localhost:3000, Juice Shop instance)
2. Run spider and AJAX spider for site discovery
3. Perform passive scanning
4. Perform active scanning with safe defaults (Low strength, Medium threshold)
5. Review, document, and export results

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Findings
- **Open Redirect** (High)  
- **Session ID in URL Rewrite** (Medium)  
- **CSP / Anti-clickjacking Headers Missing** (Medium)  
- **Private IP Disclosure** (Low)  
- **Outdated JS Library** (Medium)  

Each issue includes recommended mitigations such as stronger headers, avoiding sensitive data in URLs, and patching dependencies.

## üìä Deliverables
- [Full HTML Report](docs/owasp-zap-report.html)  
- [Screenshots](docs/screenshots/) ‚Äì ZAP configuration, scan results, sample findings

## üßë‚Äçüíª Skills Demonstrated
- Web Application Penetration Testing  
- Vulnerability Scanning with ZAP  
- OWASP Top 10 Awareness  
- Report Writing and Documentation
